I"ç<p>This is the recipe that rocked reddit, coming our way via <a href="https://www.today.com/today/amp/tdna199419">Today</a> (believe it or not). It takes just minutes with almost no prep (use a slow cooker liner for no cleanup), and the leftovers can be used for sandwiches or nachos or eggs. If you like a thicker gravy, combine the dripping with flour/starch, or just enjoy the thinner jus.</p>
