I"3<p>Risotto is one of those recipes that sound tough but really isn’t that tricky (but is totally tasty). This recipe is a mash between a <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/grilled-mushroom-risotto/">Jamie Oliver</a> method and a <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/mushroom-risotto">Tasty 101 video</a>. Jamie asked for dried mushrooms (proved to be hard to find and expensive here) and Tasty didn’t have enough mushroom punch (so we added back the roasted topper). The best of both worlds, and easier than I’ve previously imagined!</p>
