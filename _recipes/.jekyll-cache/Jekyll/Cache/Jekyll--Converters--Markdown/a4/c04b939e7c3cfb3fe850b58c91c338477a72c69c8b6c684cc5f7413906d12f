I"A<p>This is another recipe we saw on Jamie Oliver’s TV show, and we can’t stop making it. It’s perfect for parties, and pairs well with any rich dip (we’ve been doing greek yogurt topped with hot sauce and tahini). We’ve also rolled things other than carrots, changed the flavors, made news dips— go wild!</p>
