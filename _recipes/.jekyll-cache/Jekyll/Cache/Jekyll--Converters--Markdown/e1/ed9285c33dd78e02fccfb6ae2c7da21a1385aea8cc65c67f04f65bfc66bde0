I"í<p>We first discovered this dish at <a href="https://www.thelinehotel.com/austin/food-drink/">Arlo Grey</a> in Downtown Austin, and since, itâ€™s taken on a life of its own. Weâ€™ve cooked it a number of times and itâ€™s slowly evolved (mainly to become easier to cook, if you can believe it). Itâ€™s one of our favorite vegetarian dishes and can easily swing vegan (just replace the dairy with something like hummus).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s vegetables that eat like a full-on meat lasagna. Dang.</p>
