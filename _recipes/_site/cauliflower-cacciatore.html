<p>We first discovered this dish at <a href="https://www.thelinehotel.com/austin/food-drink/">Arlo Grey</a> in Downtown Austin, and since, it’s taken on a life of its own. We’ve cooked it a number of times and it’s slowly evolved (mainly to become easier to cook, if you can believe it). It’s one of our favorite vegetarian dishes and can easily swing vegan (just replace the dairy with something like hummus).</p>

<p>It’s vegetables that eat like a full-on meat lasagna. Dang.</p>
