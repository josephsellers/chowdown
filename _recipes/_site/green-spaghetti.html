<p>We saw this on Jamie Oliver’s TV show and made it that night. He calls for <strong>cavolo nero</strong> as the greens, but dinosaur kale or spinach or any dark leafy green will do. The bigger the green, the easier it is to fish out of the boiling water, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Start to finish this whole recipe takes about 10 minutes, but it’s pretty rapid fire once you get stated. Have plates and an appetite standing by.</p>
